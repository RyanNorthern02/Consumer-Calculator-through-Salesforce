# Consumer-Calculator-through-Salesforce

## Description
The **Consumer Choice Calculator** is a web-based tool that calculates the total cost of a sale, factoring in the sale amount, tax, discounts, and optional tip. It is designed to assist consumers in understanding how different inputs, such as tax and tips, affect the final transaction cost.

The application consists of three main files:
- `HTML`: The structure of the page where users input values.
- `CSS`: The styling that provides a clean and professional user interface.
- `JavaScript`: Handles the business logic, validation, and calculations for the form.

## Files in the Project

   - Provides the basic structure and layout of the form fields, allowing users to input values like sale amount, tax percentage, discount, and tip.

2. **CSS for Consumer Choice Calculator.CSS** (`style.css`)
   - Contains the styles used to format the input fields, labels, and buttons, making the application visually appealing.

3. **JS For Calculator.JS** (`script.js`)
